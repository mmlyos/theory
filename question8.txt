Q: what is the diffrence between commit and commit amend?

ans: 
    the main diffrence between them is that the commit --amend modify the last commit 
    no new version or commit just a change in the last commit.

    but

    the commit itself creates a new commit.
    a new version or a new checkpoint to access in future.
