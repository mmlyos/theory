A conflict --> occurs in Git when changes in the same part of a file are made on two different branches and Git cannot automatically merge them.
To resolve it, you manually edit the conflicted file to choose or combine the changes, remove Git’s conflict markers , stage the file with `git add`, and then continue the operation with `git commit` (for merge) or `git rebase --continue` (for rebase).
