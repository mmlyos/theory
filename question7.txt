Q: what is the difference between "git pull" and "git fetch"?

ans:

    the main difference between them is ->

    the "git fetch" gets the changes but save the last changes on your local repository.
    but
    the "git pull" gets the changes from repository and immediately changes the last changes on your local repository.

    the git pull is like " git fetch + git merge ".
